          <h2>5. Data Protection and Confidentiality</h2>
          <p>
            Personal data (age, gender, etc.) will be recorded while
            participation. The researcher will not identify you by your real
            name in any reports using information obtained from this online
            study and that your confidentiality as a participant in this online
            study will remain secure and encrypted. All data you provide in this
            online study will be published anonymized and treated confidentially
            in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of
            the European Union (EU). Subsequent uses of records and data will be
            subject to standard data use policies which protect the full
            anonymity of the participating individuals. In all cases, uses of
            records and data will be subject to the GDPR. Faculty and
            administrators from the campus will not have access to raw data or
            transcripts. This precaution will prevent your individual comments
            from having any negative repercussions. This site uses cookies and
            other tracking technologies to conduct the research, to improve the
            user experience, the ability to interact with the system and to
            provide additional content from third parties. Despite careful
            control of content, the researchers assume no liability for damages,
            which directly or indirectly result from the use of this online
            application. Any recordings cannot be viewed by anyone outside this
            research project unless we have you sign a separate permission form
            allowing us to use them (see below). Records that have not been made
            public are automatically deleted after the end of the research. The
            records will be destroyed if you contact the researcher to destroy
            or delete them immediately. As with any publication or online
            related activity, the risk of a breach of confidentiality is always
            possible. According to the GDPR, the researchers will inform the
            participant if a breach of confidential data was detected.
